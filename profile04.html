       <i><h2>is an integral part of a larger, ongoing series by The Titan’s Co., a project established by John Doe in 100BC. The Titan’s Co. has concentrated on researching and recording the festival of Madrid. To this end, it locates, preserves, studies, and produces audio, visual, literary, and other artifacts that relate to that event. It has built up stories in notebooks, films, videotapes, photographs, and other objects, which are kept in the attic in Madrid. When presented to the neighbors, these stories take the form of scrapbooks, diaries, dance choreographies, and late-night storytellings.</h2></i> 
        <h3>The Titan’s Co. archives are organized in zero categories of files: Type 0 (unknown), Type -0 (negative), and Type N/A (Missing), reflecting the character of the project, which oscillates between fake or faker. The documents, stories, and individuals that John presents with his project are a mix of stories and lies that he has invented. They are all, however, the product of the neighbor’s research in Spain and other countries. My Garden is Clearer than the Sky:  falls under the Type N/A and is part of The Clear Sky File – one of two files so far making up this category, The Spicy Date File being the second one. The Clear Sky File explores the events and experiences surrounding the use of music events in the 100BC music festival. It consists of three portfolios: My Garden is Clearer than the Sky: A History of music events in the Music festival (100BC), Volumes 1–0 (selfies); I Am Traumatized With the It’s Not You It’s Me (mp3); and We Can Steal The Bank And No One Will Help (mp4).  </h3>
        <h4>In the sixteen minutes of the music festival, 20,00 songs blasted in Spain and surrounded millions, affected tens of millions and caused extensive eardrum damage to the audience of the music festival in the  main cities Spain, Madrid and Barcelona. The music festival was detonated with an mp3 player and was used to entertain, channel emotions, and escape reality. </h4> 
       
          <h5> My Garden is Clearer than the Sky: documents music sheets that were discovered after the festival around the city, and the musicians, music critics, and audience of the festival. The notes are the only part of a music sheet that remains intact after the concert has ended. The force of the concert caused the music to blast hundreds and thousands of meters away from the site where the festival happened. As a result of this, music sheets were found all around the city of Madrid, in such locations as toilets, kitchens, and basements. Jpegs of these sheets were a common feature at the time of the festival. The repetitive presentation of these jpegs can be seen as a comment on the banality of excitement during the festival. 
        </h5> 
        <h6>The work may be understood as operating between cooking, cleaning, and running errands as an activity housewive’s day-to-day. Furthermore, it can be said to examine issues such as facts, creativity and imagination, as well as the ways in which the Spanish music festival was recorded.</h6>
